                    <p> Besides being a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I'm also a family girl and an activist. I'm driven by my personal ambitions and my social agenda. I've always worked hard aiming personal growth, good reputation and a professional reference, hoping I cause an impact contributing with my services. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Since an early age I taught English for a living, until I found out about programming in college. After I passed in computer science class, I completed a JavaScript bootcamp, wich led me to work nearly 2 years teaching basic programming and power skills to minority groups (along other employability issues). My first role was working at "Gama Academy" with PWD studants - a class financed by Ita√∫ Bank - where I assisted with git, HTML, CSS and Agile; and at this same company, I also tutored a full-female class in programming logic and node.JS, financed by the retail chain "Magalu".
                    </p>
                    <p> My second job (Generation Brazil - a social vulnerability driven NGO) consisted for the first 6 months on lecturing behaviour management and mentalities that are required at a work space, developing studants professionalism and social-emocional intelligence. The other 6 months consisted on applying basic JavaScript to a face-to-face class from Rio, meaning I went to live there for half a year.

                        <p> My career extends completly into the teaching area, and for the past couple years I've worked using web development as a social ascension tool for those who need an opportunity to entry into the job market the most, and I couldn't be more fullfiled about that. Now I'm seeking an opportunity to myself, so I can develop to keep contributing to others.
